# Computational Science
## Program At a Glance
- Students have the option to complete a thesis, or a project. A project/thesis proposal, as well as project/thesis defense, are required.
- The focus during the first year of the program is core and elective coursework, and formulating and starting the project or thesis.
- During the second year of the program, a student will primarily work on his/her project or thesis, and take elective courses are needed and agreed upon by his/her advisor.
- You are required to take earn 18 credits from electives and research. The  minimum number of credits for electives is 8.
- You may take all 18 credits from electives. Under special circumstances, you may take as electives Individual Study. This is especially recommended if you prefer to do more specialized research.
