# Advanced Algorithms for Scientific Computing

Taken Winter of 2024. Some assignments were completed as a collaborative effort with other students.

## Description:
The course presents specialized algorithms and data structures for scientific computing and it a continuation of CS 528.

### Prerequisites:
Prerequisite: CS 528.

### Credits:
(4)

### Learner Outcomes:
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:

- Demonstrate advanced data structures: B-trees, Fibonacci Heaps, van Emde Boas Trees, Skip Lists.
- Analyze how to use Nearest Neighbor Search with KD-trees in machine learning.
- Calculate the complexity of string-matching  algorithms, parallelization complexity of multithreaded algorithms, FFT and its application areas.
- Create number-theoretic algorithms and applications for encryption-decryption: public-key cryptosystem (RSA public-key cryptosystem, primality testing, integer factorization, the AKS primality test).
- Evaluate the importance of approximation algorithms and NP-complete problems in discrete optimization.
